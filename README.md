# HashSorter

This program is a hashing algorithm for sorting large data input. It uses .txt files with large quantities of random integers (10,000,
55,000, 11,011) as test files. The goal is to sort the integers as evenly as possible.

The sorter creates a nice hash table by using the modulus operator with a prime number (as is tradition).
